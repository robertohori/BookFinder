- **How long did you spend on the coding assignment?**

  Around 4 hours

  - **What would you add to your solution if you had more time?**

    Probably external search using a router or create another project complete in ES6.

  - **If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.**

    Probably I could create more testing, cypress, or something like that.

- **What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.**

  Because I didn't do my project in ES6, I need to use a lot of hooks and useRef .My goal was to try to create both ways, but in the end, because of the time, I decided to keep only JSX.

- **How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?**

  I think the performance is okay. I use pagination direct to their API, which helps a lot. I also tried to use the minimum code and component for being simple.
  When I ran Lighthouse, everything was over 93, so I think it was okay.

- **How would you improve the API that you just used?**

  Unfortunately, I couldn't add the order by title, I checked the documentation, and it seems like they will release it soon. It is still waiting for commit.
  I also tried to load all and kind of sort by title, but I didn't like it for two reasons: they don't allow me to load all content. Second, because it was slow, but they should definitely add it.
  What I did was for the pagination. It will order by title, but not for the whole results. https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary/issues/201
